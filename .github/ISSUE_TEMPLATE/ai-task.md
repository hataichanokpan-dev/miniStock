## Goal
Create a professional minimal dashboard layout with consistent theme tokens (colors + spacing) so future screens are easy to build.

## Context
- Use TailwindCSS with a minimal professional design.
- Primary palette: gray/black/navy/red
- Status colors: yellow/red/green
- Avoid gradients and flashy styling.

## Requirements

- [ ] Add a minimal Dashboard page with placeholder cards (e.g., Watchlist, Market summary, Alerts)
- [ ] Create theme tokens (Tailwind config or CSS vars) for the palette
- [ ] Keep components simple and reusable
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] App has a clean dashboard page at `/`
- [ ] Theme tokens exist and are used (no random colors)
- [ ] Build passes with no errors
